      <h2>Our Story</h2>
      <p>
        NepalKart was born in Kathmandu in 2022, when a group of friends saw how many small artisans and rural farms struggled to reach customers beyond their village markets. We built an online marketplace where every corner of Nepal— from the terraced fields of Pokhara to the handcrafted studios of Bhaktapur — can showcase its products to a national audience.
      </p>
      <p>
        Today, we serve thousands of customers across all seven provinces, delivering authentic Nepali goods right to your doorstep.
